        <h2>Protection of Minors</h2>

        <p>Backchat does not permit children under the age of 13 to register on the Backchat App or use any of its functionality for which registration is required. If you are between the age of 13 and 18 years old, you may use the Backchat App but only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>

This includes, but is not limited to, your name, home or business address, email address, telephone number, and debit or credit card information such as the credit card number or billing address. Backchat respects your privacy. Backchat only collects PII through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email, survey information, and online registration forms. The types and amount of personal information collected from these activities will vary, but in no event will we collect PII that is not voluntarily given by you when using the Backchat App. You consent to Backchat using your PII to facilitate requests, to contact you if a problem arises, email you information about our Backchat Apps, or for other uses consistent with this Policy and your requests.</p>

If Backchat were to cease operations, your data might be transferred to and used by another company, which offers similar or related products. While we cannot predict a great deal about such an unlikely event, we would hope this would provide you with continuity of Backchat App. The Backchat App gives you the ability to share your PII with other Backchat Users.

Accordingly, we cannot be held responsible for third parties' use of your PII or Non-PII.</p>
