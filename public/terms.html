Backchat reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Backchat Content and any User Submissions that Backchat, in its sole discretion, considers to be in violation of these Terms of Service or otherwise harmful to the App or Users of the App.</p>

      <h2>Links</h2>

      <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that Backchat is not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by Backchat of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>

      <p>You may stop using the App at any time and may terminate the App by disabling the App from your mobile phone. Without limiting other remedies, Backchat may at any time suspend, terminate, or refuse to provide you with access to the App. If Backchat terminates, disables or suspends your Backchat account for any reason, you will not create another Backchat account without first receiving Backchat's express written permission to do so.</p>

      <p>After termination for any reason, you understand and acknowledge that we will have no further obligation to provide the App to you and all licenses and other rights granted to you by these Terms of Service will immediately cease. Backchat will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of the App. UPON ANY TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION, ANY CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING USER SUBMISSIONS) THAT YOU HAVE SUBMITTED VIA THE APP WILL NO LONGER BE ACCESSIBLE BY YOU.</p>

      <p>Any suspension, termination or cancellation will not affect your obligations to Backchat under these Terms of Service (including, without limitation, proprietary rights and ownership, licenses to Backchat, indemnification and limitation of liability), which naturally are intended to survive such suspension, termination or cancellation.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

      <p>THE APP, Backchat CONTENT AND USER SUBMISSIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, Backchat EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. Backchat MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE APP, Backchat CONTENT OR USER SUBMISSIONS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM Backchat OR THROUGH THE APP, Backchat CONTENT OR USER SUBMISSIONS, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.</p>

      <h2>Indemnity</h2>

      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Backchat, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with User Submissions, your access to or use of the App, or Backchat Content, or your violation of these Terms of Service.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the App, Backchat Content and User Submissions and any other content therein remains with you. Neither Backchat nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the App, Backchat Content or User Submissions will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service or from the use of or inability to use the App or Content therein, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Backchat has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. You specifically acknowledge that Backchat is not liable for the defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with you.</p>

      <p>In no event will Backchat's aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service or from the use of or inability to use the App or Content therein exceed twenty U.S. dollars ($20). The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Backchat and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>

      <h2>Trademark Rights</h2>

      <p>All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of Backchat used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Backchat. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.</p>

      <h2>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

      <p>These Terms of Service and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Service will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>

      <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>

      <p>These Terms of Service (including the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Backchat and you regarding the App and Backchat Content, and these Terms of Service supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Backchat and you regarding the App and Backchat Content.</p>

      <h2>Assignment</h2>

      <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Service, by operation of law or otherwise, without Backchat's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Service, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Backchat may freely assign these Terms of Service. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Service will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

      <h2>Notices</h2>

      <p>You consent to the use of: (i) electronic means to complete these Terms of Service and to deliver any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder; and (ii) electronic records to store information related to these Terms of Service or your use of App. Any notices or other communications required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms of Service, will be in writing and given: (x) by Backchat via email if applicable (in each case to the address that you provide); or (y) by posting to the App. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

      <h2>General</h2>

      <p>The failure of Backchat to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Backchat. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Service will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Service or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Service invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE SUBMITTED WITHIN A YEAR OF THE DATE OF OCCURRENCE OR ELSE THEY ARE WAIVED.</p>
